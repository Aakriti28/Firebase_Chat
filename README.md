<h4> For Devcom evaluation </h4>
<p> The Login.txt file contains the login credentials of a few registred users which can be used to test the functioning of features mentioned. There is always the option of registering new users too.
The Profile Picture uploading option might take a while and if the file size is large, the App may crash. No exceptions were encountered during the thorough checks I performed. The only reason for the App slowing down or crashing was a Profile Picture too large in size. Try with limited size pictures and the App should work fine.</p>
